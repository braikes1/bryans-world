        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a creative at heart who brings ideas to life through design, animation, and development. With a background in visual storytelling, I approach front-end work with an eye for detail and a passion for clean, functional design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raised in a Jamaican Christian household, I value discipline, growth, and staying grounded. That mindset shapes everything I do — from the way I build to the way I collaborate. I'm always evolving, always creating, and ready to contribute to a team that values creativity and impact.
        </p>
